# RiFRET

An [ImageJ](https://imagej.net) plugin for intensity-based three-filter set (ratiometric) FRET which works with unknown varying donor/accepter ratios, corrects for channel crosstalk and instrument calibration, and yields quantitative FRET E values.

## Getting started
1. Download the latest version of [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/). 
2. Enable the FRET Imaging [update site](https://imagej.net/update-sites/following).
3. Once installed, go to _Plugins > FRET Imaging > RiFRET_.
